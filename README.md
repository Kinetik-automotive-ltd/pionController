**Overview**

The Pion backlight control board is engineered to manage a 7x109 pixel LED matrix backlight within automotive interiors. This board leverages the STM32H743VITx microcontroller for LED control, offering dynamic picture displaying.

### Key Components

-   **Main Processor**: The STM32H743VITx microcontroller drives the control and processing of the LED matrix.
-   **CAN Transceivers**:
    -   **CAN Common**: Handles standard communication for routine vehicle operations.
    -   **CAN Critical**: Dedicated line for critical or high-priority messages within the system.
-   **Power Regulation**:
    -   **12V to 5V Regulator**: Provides a 5V supply.
    -   **5V to 3.3V Regulator**: Additional power regulation for the STM32.
-   **ESD Protection Circuit**: Protects sensitive components from electrostatic discharge.
-   **GPIO Pins (4)**: Converted from 3.3V to 5V via a voltage regulator, ensuring compatibility with external systems operating at higher voltages.
